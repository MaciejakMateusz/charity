# Project "Charity"

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Charity" project, a part of my portfolio. 
This project was created with the goal of providing a platform where 
anyone can easily donate their unwanted items to trusted institutions. 
A graduate of UX course prepared the project prototype and 
conducted extensive research and observations to develop a project blueprint. 
You can find prototypes and additional project information in the following 
sections.

## Project Inspiration
Many people have items in their homes that they no longer use but are still 
in good condition. They want to pass these items on to those who may need 
them, but they often struggle to find a simple and trustworthy way to do so. 
While there are several solutions available, many of them require additional 
effort or lack the necessary trustworthiness. Verified donation centers may 
be too far away, making it inconvenient or impossible to transport items. 
On the other hand, local collection points are unverified, and there's no 
guarantee that donated items will reach those in need.

## About CRUD
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four fundamental 
functions in applications that manage persistent data. These functions allow 
for the manipulation and management of data. Sometimes, the letter 'R' is 
expanded as "Retrieve" instead of "Read," and the letter 'D' is expanded as 
"Destroy" instead of "Delete." This acronym is also used to describe actions 
related to viewing, searching, and modifying information, especially in 
electronic documents.
